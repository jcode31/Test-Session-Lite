# Test-Session-Lite
I created this program to help my SAT private tutoring business.
My teammmate inputs student answers into a spreadsheet and sends it to me. I place it in a local Test Session Lite directory. 
This program then checks all student answers against the answer key column (in the same spreadsheet), and produces a score report that orders the questions according to which were missed most.
The program also shows which answers each student chose for each question.
